			<h2>The Origins</h2>
			<p><strong>Plate tectonics</strong>, is a scientific theory that <em>describes the large-scale motions of Earth's lithosphere.</em> The model builds on the concepts of continental drift, developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted the theory after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>

			<h2>What are Tectonic Plates?</h2>
			<p>Tectonic plates are pieces of the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle, together referred to as the lithosphere. The plates are around 100 km (62 mi) thick and consist of two principal types of material: oceanic crust (also called sima from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (sial from silicon and aluminium). The composition of the two types of crust differs markedly, with basaltic rocks (mafic) dominating oceanic crust, while continental crust consists principally of lower density granitic rocks (felsic).</p>
