				<h2>Development of the Theory</h2>
				<p>In line with other previous and contemporaneous proposals, in 1912 the meteorologist <strong>Alfred Wegener</strong> amply described what he called continental drift, expanded in his 1915 book <em>The Origin of Continents and Oceans</em> and the scientific debate started that would end up fifty years later in the theory of plate tectonics.</p>

				<h2>Continental drift</h2>
				<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the Earth's major features were fixed, and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement, described in what is called the geosynclinal theory. Generally, this was placed in the context of a contracting planet Earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short geological time.
				
				Evidence for the movement of continents on tectonic plates is now extensive. Similar plant and animal fossils are found around different continent shores, suggesting that they were once joined. The fossils of Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile, found both in Brazil and South Africa, are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land reptile Lystrosaurus from rocks of the same age from locations in South America, Africa, and Antarctica.There is also living evidenceâ€”the same animals being found on two continents.

				<h2>Floating Continents, Paleomagnetism and Seismicity Zones</h2>
				<p>As it was observed early that although granite existed on continents, seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt, the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust, named <em>sial</em> (continental type crust) and <em>sima</em> (oceanic type crust). Furthermore, it was supposed that a static shells of strata was present under the continents. It therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt (sial) underlies the continental rocks. <strong>Paleomagnetism</strong> led the revival of the continental drift hypothesis and its transformation into plate tectonics. Apparent polar wander paths provided the first clear geophysical evidence for continental drift, while marine magnetic anomalies did the same for seafloor spreading. Paleomagnetism continues to extend the history of plate tectonics back in time and are applied to the movement of continental fragments, or terranes.
