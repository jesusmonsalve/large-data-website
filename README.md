# Plate Tectonics, the layers beneath the earth.

Plate tectonics is an interesting scientific theory about how the lithosphere moves at a large-cale. It is awesome and scary to know how earthquakes occur and in which areas of the world is most promt to happen. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m looking forward to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
